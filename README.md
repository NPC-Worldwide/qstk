## Overview

Quantum Semantic Toolkit (QSTK) is a Python package for quantum semantic methods, leveraging the [npcpy](https://pypi.org/project/npcpy/) package to simplify LLM calls. QSTK is based on the observer-dependent phenomenon of meaning interpretation in natural language processing that LLMs and humans likewise exhibit. QSTK helps us effficiently use ensemble methods to explore and understand semantic meaning in context in a Markovian way.
